# PICKLE-
In Python, the pickle module is used for object serialization and deserialization. Serialization is the process of converting an object into a byte stream, which can be saved to a file or transferred over a network. Deserialization, on the other hand, is the process of reconstructing the object from the serialized byte stream.
